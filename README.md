# everydays
This will be my attempt at everydays. I'm focusing on some sort of discrete coding exercise to do each day of the week (not weekends).

At this point, I have three ideas of what those can be:

1. Complete one or more practice interview questions from Cracking the Coding Interview.
2. Implement one block/item/feature in a Minecraft mod.
3. Complete a daily challenge from [r/dailyprogrammer](http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer).

The main point of this is to keep myself coding everyday, but also have a way to supplement the days when I don't feel the creative drive to come up with an idea on my own. All of these are designed to be completed in a single day - that is, no incremental progress. It could be argued that the Minecraft mod _is_ that, but my idea there is to __not__ work on it past the initial day - besides fixing a bugs.
